# Introduction to GitHub using a basic text file

In this demo, we're going to...

1. Create a new file, and look at how it's displayed
2. Edit it, and talk about commit messages
3. View the file's history and talk about diffs
4. Upload a .txt file, and compare how it's displayed
5. Upload a .docx file, and compare how it's displayed
6. Change both the .txt and .docx file outside of GitHub, and re-upload
7. View each file's history
